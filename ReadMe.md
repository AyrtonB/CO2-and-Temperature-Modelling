This collection of notebooks includes:
* A self contained pipeline for data extraction and processing
* Probabilistic modelling & forecasting of CO2 levels 
* Probabilistic modelling of the relationship between CO2 and temperature
* Forecasts (with associated uncertainty) for future temperatures

Additionally, a number of companion notebooks outside of the main analysis flow provide visualisations and extra analysis relating to the data and models. One example includes a walkthrough on how to recreate the famous 'warming stripes' developed by Ed Hawkins.
